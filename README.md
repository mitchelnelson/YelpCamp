* Images may be uploaded/deleted through the use of Cloudinary â€“ a cloud-based image service.
* Users may leave reviews that mimic yelp; a 5-star rating system with titles and text body.
* Campgrounds, reviews, and users can be registered and posted to the site and stored safely and securely in MongoDB.
